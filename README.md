# World Weather Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this challenge is to get weather descriptions along with our weather data. Users can input their choice of temperatures using input statements to filter the data for the weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Finally, we created a travel itinerary and travel map with the markers displaying on map.

## Results

Using input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, we used those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, showing those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.
